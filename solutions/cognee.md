## One-line Summary

Cognee exposes persistent knowledge graph memory to AI tools through MCP, with standalone and shared API modes.

## Second-Brain Fit

Cognee is a strong option when the user wants persistent AI memory and graph construction with MCP-compatible clients. It sits between local/self-hosted control and hosted shared-memory platforms.

## Capabilities

| Area | Evaluation |
|---|---|
| Deployment | Standalone MCP server, Docker quickstart, local setup, or API mode connected to a centralized backend. |
| Data capture | MCP tools, data operations, API flows, and memory operations. |
| Auto-organization | Built-in knowledge graph construction and memory tools. |
| Consolidation / dreaming | Built-in improve/processing workflows, but terminology differs from "dreaming." |
| Retrieval model | Knowledge graph memory with `remember`, `recall`, `forget_memory`, and `improve` tools. |
| Agent access | MCP plus API; clients include Cursor, Claude Desktop, Continue, Cline, and Roo Code. |
| Workspace / team support | Standalone mode isolates memory; API mode supports shared graph use across clients. |
| UI / filtering | Developer/admin surfaces and tool references; end-user UI should be verified for the target workflow. |
| Privacy / control | Local mode gives more control; API mode centralizes sharing. |
| Setup burden | Medium. Docker quickstart is fast, but graph memory design still matters. |

## Strengths

- MCP-first access to knowledge graph memory.
- Clear standalone vs API mode distinction.
- Useful for codebase and project memory across compatible agents.

## Limitations

- Mode choice can fragment memory if each client runs its own standalone instance.
- More developer-oriented than consumer-oriented.
- Team and governance details depend on API/cloud setup.

## Relationship to Membase

Cognee is a graph-memory alternative for users who want MCP plus local/API deployment choices. Membase is easier for hosted cross-agent personal/team memory with Memory and Wiki stores.
