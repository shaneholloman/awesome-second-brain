## Reading Notes

- `Built-in` does not always mean automatic quality. Imported data may still need review, schema cleanup, source labels, or deletion policies.
- `Integration` means a documented connector, plugin, SDK, or supported bridge exists.
- `Custom collector` means the workflow is feasible but the user must own source-specific code, OAuth, rate limits, retries, and normalization.
- `Not primary fit` should be used when a product can be forced into a workflow but is not designed for it.
