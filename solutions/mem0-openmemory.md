- Last reviewed: 2026-05-29

## One-line Summary

Mem0 is a memory engine for AI agents that supports hosted and self-hosted paths, layered memory types, APIs, SDKs, and MCP access.

## Second-Brain Fit

Mem0 is strongest as infrastructure for products and agents, not as a consumer notes app. It fits users who want programmable memory with user/session/org scopes and are comfortable designing the memory lifecycle.

## Capabilities

| Area | Evaluation |
|---|---|
| Deployment | Hosted Mem0 Platform or open-source self-hosted setup. |
| Data capture | API/SDK memory writes, MCP tools, and framework integrations. |
| Auto-organization | Built-in memory layers: conversation, session, user, and organizational memory. |
| Consolidation / dreaming | Partial. Memory promotion and retrieval are built in, but an explicit user-facing dream loop is not the core model. |
| Retrieval model | Layered memory search with metadata, user IDs, run IDs, and platform retrieval features. |
| Agent access | MCP plus API/SDK integrations. |
| Workspace / team support | Organizational memory and platform governance features are documented. |
| UI / filtering | Platform dashboard and self-hosted dashboard/server paths; metadata filtering in self-hosted docs. |
| Privacy / control | Hosted or self-hosted. OSS path gives infrastructure and data control. |
| Setup burden | Medium. Hosted MCP is quick; self-hosting requires provider, vector store, and server decisions. |

## Strengths

- Strong developer API and SDK story.
- Hosted and self-hosted choices.
- Clear user/session/org memory model.
- MCP is documented for agent clients.

## Limitations

- Less consumer-ready as a standalone second-brain app.
- Requires memory scope design to avoid noisy or unsafe recall.
- External app capture depends on integrations or custom application code.

## Relationship to Membase

Mem0 is a developer-oriented memory engine. Membase is more directly packaged for AI power users who want shared memory across daily agents with low setup burden.
