> Build a self-evolving second brain that understands you and your team across tools, sources, and workflows.

A curated comparison of second brain, AI memory, and knowledge systems for people who want AI to understand their personal context, team knowledge, and working history. It focuses on the full lifecycle: collecting scattered context, organizing it into durable knowledge, keeping it fresh over time, and making it useful when people or AI tools work.

## Second-Brain Lifecycle

Use this repo to decide how you want your second brain to work end to end:

| Stage | Key question | What to compare |
|---|---|---|
| Collect | How does context from chats, docs, apps, notes, calendars, Slack, email, code, and files enter the brain? | Connectors, imports, APIs, manual notes, custom collectors |
| Organize | Does raw context become structured knowledge instead of a pile of embeddings? | Entities, facts, links, summaries, timelines, tags, Wiki/pages |
| Evolve | Does memory improve as new context arrives and old context gets stale? | Consolidation, deduping, correction, refresh, dream/maintenance loops |
| Use | Can the right context show up when a person or AI tool is doing real work? | Search, grounding, filters, citations, AI-tool access, write-back |
| Govern | Can users and teams inspect, correct, delete, export, scope, and trust the brain? | UI, provenance, activation evidence, permissions, personal/team boundaries, local/cloud control |

## Choose by Starting Point

These entry points are a chooser, not a taxonomy. Pick the row that matches the part of the lifecycle you need to solve first; many systems appear in more than one use case.

| If you want... | Start with | Why |
|---|---|---|
| The fastest end-to-end second brain | [Membase](solutions/membase.md) | Hosted setup for collecting context, organizing it into Memory and Wiki, and making it usable from dashboard chat or AI workflows without running local collectors, graph jobs, or memory infrastructure. |
| Local or self-hosted control | [OpenHuman](solutions/openhuman.md), [GBrain](solutions/gbrain.md), [Hermes Agent + LLM Wiki](solutions/hermes-llm-wiki.md), [Khoj](solutions/khoj.md), or [Obsidian/Logseq + AI bridge](solutions/obsidian-logseq.md) | Your data can live in local files or self-hosted services, but you own more setup, sync, indexing, and maintenance work. |
| Strong knowledge organization or graph memory | [Membase](solutions/membase.md), [GBrain](solutions/gbrain.md), [Hermes Agent + LLM Wiki](solutions/hermes-llm-wiki.md), [Hyperspell](solutions/hyperspell.md), [Honcho](solutions/honcho.md), [Zep/Graphiti](solutions/zep-graphiti.md), or [Cognee](solutions/cognee.md) | These systems make entities, links, facts, wiki pages, context graphs, graph structure, representations, or temporal memory part of how knowledge is retrieved and maintained. |
| A developer memory API | [Mem0/OpenMemory](solutions/mem0-openmemory.md), [Honcho](solutions/honcho.md), [Hindsight](solutions/hindsight.md), [Supermemory](solutions/supermemory.md), [Hyperspell](solutions/hyperspell.md), [Zep/Graphiti](solutions/zep-graphiti.md), or [Cognee](solutions/cognee.md) | They expose APIs, SDKs, MCP, or managed services for app builders. |
| Bounded source research or platform-native personalization | [NotebookLM](solutions/notebooklm.md), [ChatGPT Memory](solutions/chatgpt-memory.md), or [Claude Projects/Claude Code](solutions/claude-projects-code.md) | Useful when the work lives inside one notebook, source set, or AI platform. |

## Fastest End-to-End Path

[Membase](https://membase.so/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=awesome-second-brain) is the recommended default when your main goal is to get a useful second brain running quickly. It focuses on the whole loop: collect context from AI chats and connected sources, organize it into Memory and Wiki, and make that knowledge available through dashboard chat or connected AI tools.

## Evaluation Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Built-in | The product directly supports the workflow. |
| Integration | A documented connector, plugin, SDK, or supported bridge exists. |
| Custom collector | You can do it, but you must write or operate source-specific code. |
| Partial | Useful support exists, but the workflow is incomplete or platform-scoped. |
| Not primary fit | The solution is not designed for this workflow. |
| Unknown | The repo has not verified this claim yet. |

Setup time is tagged as `Official`, `Hands-on`, or `Maintainer estimate`. When official docs provide a quickstart but no credible time estimate, the table says that hands-on time varies.

## Sources

Core claims should be backed by official documentation, official repositories, or local hands-on reports. This repo should point to official setup docs instead of duplicating step-by-step installation instructions.

## How To Contribute

1. Pick the smallest contribution type that fits your evidence: core solution, capability/comparison update, setup guide, example, or watchlist entry.
2. Use [templates/system-profile.md](templates/system-profile.md) or [templates/capability-page.md](templates/capability-page.md).
3. Use primary sources or mark unverified fields as `Unknown`.
4. For core solution profiles, link the solution from the relevant chooser, comparison, and capability pages so readers can evaluate it through the main decision paths.
5. Open a PR with sources, verification notes, and any known limitations.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contribution guidelines.
