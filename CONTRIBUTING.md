# Contributing to Awesome AI Second Brain

This repo compares existing tools and products for building AI-native second brains. Contributions should help a reader decide what to use, how to set it up, and which workflows are actually supported.

## What Counts

Good contributions answer practical questions:

- Where does memory live: local, hosted, self-hosted, or platform-bound?
- How long does it take to get the first useful memory?
- What data can it ingest?
- Does raw data become organized knowledge automatically?
- Does it support consolidation, reflection, or a dream cycle?
- Can agents read and write through MCP, API, SDK, CLI, or plugins?
- Can users separate personal, project, workspace, and team scopes?
- What can users inspect, edit, delete, export, or audit?

## How To Add a Solution

1. Copy [templates/system-profile.md](templates/system-profile.md) into `solutions/<solution-name>.md`.
2. If it is a full-profile solution, copy [templates/build-guide.md](templates/build-guide.md) into `setup-guides/<solution-name>.md`.
3. Add the solution to [solutions/README.md](solutions/README.md), [README.md](README.md), and the relevant comparison tables.
4. Update capability pages under `capabilities/` only for workflows you can source or verify.
5. Mark uncertain fields as `Unknown` instead of guessing.

## How To Add a Setup Guide

Setup guides should focus on using existing OSS projects, hosted products, and memory layers. Avoid turning them into from-scratch implementation tutorials.

Every setup guide should include:

- what you are building
- when to choose or avoid the path
- prerequisites
- setup time tagged as `Official`, `Hands-on`, or `Maintainer estimate`
- install or connection steps
- data-source setup
- agent connection
- verification steps
- known failure modes
- sources

## Profile Quality Bar

Every solution profile should answer:

- deployment model
- data capture model
- auto-organization model
- consolidation or dreaming model
- retrieval model
- agent access surfaces
- workspace and team support
- UI and filtering surfaces
- privacy, control, and portability
- setup burden
- relationship to Membase

## Sources

Use primary sources whenever possible:

- official docs
- official repositories
- maintainer-written examples
- product docs and changelogs
- reproducible local test reports

When using local or internal test reports, summarize them clearly and avoid presenting unverified assumptions as product claims.

## Writing Style

- Be factual and specific.
- Prefer setup-oriented wording over market-map wording.
- Distinguish built-in support from integration support and custom collector work.
- Use the standard support labels from [README.md](README.md).
- Keep `Relationship to Membase` analytical, not promotional.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- One solution or workflow per PR is preferred.
- Include sources and verification notes.
- Keep unrelated formatting changes out of the PR.
- If a page is a placeholder or watchlist entry, label it clearly as not fully evaluated.
