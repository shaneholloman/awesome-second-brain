# Memory Evolution

## What This Capability Means

Memory evolution is the ongoing work that keeps a second brain useful after capture: summarization, deduplication, fact repair, stale embedding repair, source cleanup, pruning, reflection, or synthesis.

## Evaluation Questions

- Is there a named maintenance or evolution loop?
- Is it product-managed, user-operated, or custom?
- Does it repair retrieval quality or only summarize?
- Can users inspect proposed changes before they become durable memory?

## Solution Matrix

| Solution | Support label | Adoption path | Caveats |
|---|---|---|---|
| Membase | Built-in | Smart digesting and managed product updates. | Schedule/internal mechanics are product-managed. |
| OpenHuman | Partial | Auto-fetch every 20 minutes, memory collapse, background thinking. | Not yet verified as a durable curated-knowledge loop. |
| GBrain | Built-in | `gbrain dream` maintenance cycle, `gbrain autopilot`, sync/embed jobs. | User operates jobs and verifies quality. |
| Hermes Agent + LLM Wiki | Partial | The bundled skill defines re-ingest, source drift checks, query filing, lint, archive, page splitting, and log rotation. | Not an autonomous maintenance loop by default; user or Hermes automation must trigger upkeep. |
| Supermemory | Built-in | Product-managed graph memory updates, relationship tracking, and automatic forgetting. | Not exposed as a user-operated dream loop. |
| Mem0/OpenMemory | Partial | Memory promotion/search behavior and platform processing. | Explicit consolidation policy is app-owned. |
| Zep/Graphiti | Built-in | Temporal graph updates, facts, summaries. | Application must ingest updates correctly. |
| Cognee | Built-in | `improve` and graph processing workflows. | Terminology differs from dreaming. |
| Khoj | Partial | Indexing and assistant workflows. | No central dream loop in this repo's current evaluation. |
| Obsidian/Logseq + AI bridge | Custom collector | Nightly scripts, plugins, or external memory services. | User owns review and write-back safety. |
| ChatGPT Memory | Built-in | Platform-managed memory behavior. | Not exposed as a user-operated maintenance loop. |
| Claude Projects/Claude Code | Built-in | Platform RAG/project knowledge behavior. | Not a user-operated dream loop. |
| NotebookLM | Partial | Summaries and generated artifacts. | Not an ongoing second-brain maintenance loop. |
