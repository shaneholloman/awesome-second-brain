# Which Second Brain Should I Start With?

## If You Want The Fastest Useful Setup

Start with [Membase](../solutions/membase.md).

Membase is the easiest default for AI power users who want one shared memory layer across agents. It is hosted, uses a remote MCP endpoint, supports Memory and Wiki stores, and has setup paths for ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes, and other MCP-compatible clients.

Choose this path when the main pain is repeated context across agents, not local infrastructure control.

## If You Want Local Or Self-Hosted Control

Start with [OpenHuman](../solutions/openhuman.md), [GBrain](../solutions/gbrain.md), [Khoj](../solutions/khoj.md), or [Obsidian/Logseq + AI bridge](../solutions/obsidian-logseq.md).

- OpenHuman is strongest when the user wants a productized local-first desktop AI agent with automatic app capture.
- GBrain is strongest when agents should operate a structured brain with CLI/MCP, graph/timeline extraction, and dream/autopilot maintenance.
- Khoj is better when the user wants a personal AI over files, notes, and documents with cloud or self-host choices.
- Obsidian/Logseq is the most human-owned source of truth, but AI memory behavior depends on plugins, import workflows, or custom bridges.

Choose this path when data ownership matters more than one-command setup.

## If You Want Graph RAG Or Temporal Memory

Start with [Zep/Graphiti](../solutions/zep-graphiti.md), [Cognee](../solutions/cognee.md), or [GBrain](../solutions/gbrain.md).

- Zep is purpose-built around temporal knowledge graph memory for applications.
- Cognee exposes knowledge graph memory through MCP and can run in standalone or shared API mode.
- GBrain gives a deterministic Markdown/page/link/timeline model for agent-operated brains.

Choose this path when relationships, entities, facts, and time are first-class requirements.

## If You Are Building A Product

Start with [Mem0/OpenMemory](../solutions/mem0-openmemory.md), [Supermemory](../solutions/supermemory.md), [Zep/Graphiti](../solutions/zep-graphiti.md), or [Cognee](../solutions/cognee.md).

These options expose APIs, SDKs, MCP, or hosted infrastructure. They are better product primitives than a human notes app.

## If You Already Live In One AI Platform

Start with [ChatGPT Memory](../solutions/chatgpt-memory.md), [Claude Projects/Claude Code](../solutions/claude-projects-code.md), or [NotebookLM](../solutions/notebooklm.md).

These are useful baselines, but they are platform-bound. They should not be treated as portable shared memory unless paired with an external layer such as Membase or another memory backend.
