## One-line Summary

Supermemory provides a hosted memory layer with MCP, API, SDKs, connectors, project scoping, RAG, and memory graph concepts.

## Second-Brain Fit

Supermemory is a strong fit when the user wants cross-tool memory and developer-facing APIs. It overlaps with Membase on the "one memory across agents" problem, but is framed more as a memory API/developer platform.

## Capabilities

| Area | Evaluation |
|---|---|
| Deployment | Hosted MCP at `https://mcp.supermemory.ai/mcp` plus API platform. |
| Data capture | Built-in connectors for Google Drive, Gmail, Notion, OneDrive, GitHub, and Web Crawler; API ingestion for custom apps. |
| Auto-organization | Built-in document processing, memory graph, metadata, and filtering concepts. |
| Consolidation / dreaming | Partial. The platform processes and indexes synced content, but a user-visible dreaming loop is not the primary positioning. |
| Retrieval model | Search, RAG, memory graph, and API retrieval surfaces. |
| Agent access | Built-in MCP, OAuth/API-key auth, API, SDK, and supported MCP clients. |
| Workspace / team support | Project scoping and container tags help separate contexts. Team governance should be verified for the target plan. |
| UI / filtering | Hosted app, console, project scoping, connector status, and API filters. |
| Privacy / control | Hosted by default. Data deletion and connector retention semantics should be verified per connector. |
| Setup burden | Low-medium. MCP setup is minutes; connector/API setup adds more work. |

## Strengths

- Strong MCP and developer API story.
- Broad documented connector set.
- Project scoping is explicit in MCP setup.
- Good fit for apps that need memory as a service.

## Limitations

- Hosted platform by default.
- Less local-control-oriented than GBrain, Khoj, or Obsidian/Logseq.
- Consolidation behavior is less explicit than systems with named dream/autopilot loops.

## Relationship to Membase

Supermemory is a close alternative in the shared-memory layer category. Membase has a clearer Memory/Wiki split and a more direct "easiest shared agent memory" story; Supermemory is especially relevant for users who want API-first memory and connectors.
